235, imitating Branghton

342, Mr Villars FID?

other examples? see her use of dialogue

throughout, her style

#### more Evelina

Last week: Talked about context, talked about reading experience, what's new in the narration here, compared her to Pamela, talked about B vs Orville - talked about the fact that these are designed comparisons

Talked about class, class in the novel - 104, Captain Mirvan, MadameDuval

Talked about rtistic representation and class  - 28, Garrick; 84-5, musueum; 87, play; 103, opera; 116, Pantheon; 216, Vauxhall (mistaken for actress)

Surface and depth:

Think about the novel’s dramatization of the arbitrary link between surface and depth (vs Evelina’s misreading of it – see page 29 on ‘good company” and “dressed” – but she learns from Orville that (35) manners and understanding are more important

//perhaps remember end of Armstrong on surface and depth


#### Ignatious Sancho and letter-writing in the late 18th c

influence of epistolary novels on personal writing

private vs public, and in between - see Sancho preface, see rep of letters in novels

#### for Wednesday








### Friday, Oct 13 2023

### Habermas

We've talked about some of the public spaces like the play and the opera and how Evelina is scrutenized when she's there, only to be found to be "nobody" and "private" - Habermas is going to help us think further about an 18th world in which “Subjectivity, as the innermost core of the private, was always already oriented to an audience.”

We've talked about letters in their public and private guises

Go to handout

Groups, handout

### the two endings? (20 min)

#### marriage ending + letters

So we talked about Habermas: recap

How do we read the (two) endings of Evelina?

342, Sir John Belmont

390, Orville proposes - she loses consciousness almost

992, "I hardly know, my lord, to whom I most belong"

(Can think back to Habermas and McKeon)

Her name - 432, "not knowing what name to sign, I was obliged to send it without any"

448, signs "Evelina Belmont"

450, the last name in the book, like the first name on the page: "Evelina"

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

427, the letter from Caroline, never unsealed (LETTER DEVICE - ?)

The LETTER - 286-7, the false letter; 297-8, Mr Villars reading; 430, Willougby confesses "I answered in Lord Orville's name"

RELATION TO FID ???????

#### Monkey ending (5 min)

413 and 428,Evelina's likeness to Caroline (birth, genre)

What about the monkey? 443-444

315, Mrs. Beaumont thinks that “birth and virtue” are the same

Ending with minor characters, and esp Monkey [compare with the endings Pam and RC – Lovel and Mirvan on seeing and looking]

LAST WORD IN NOVEL - EVELINA

### for Monday after break

Read Northanger Abbey

Read SELECTIONS from The Woman of Colour, read the short review of our edition, and consider skimming

-------------------------------

Week 6 note

Dear Rise,

Week 6! The last week before October break!

1. IMPORTANT: at the beginning of class Friday, I failed to mention the most important thing - I deferred the due date for Writing Assignment #3 to Wednesday midnight, to match the deferral of the draft, and updated the syllabus to reflect that. Please use the time to dig deep into those revisions.

2. Monday we will learn about narrated monologue and free indirect discourse, as promised, and will use that new knowledge to look more closely at narration in *Evelina* - what has changed since *Pamela*? How are Evelina's letters (and the letters of other characters) different, but individually and as a group? We will also develop a new way to talk and think about the third-person narration we will encounter as we encounter Jane Austen's *Northanger Abbey* after break.

We will continue our discussion about *Evelina* and class; note for example the character Mrs. Beaumont (p 315), who thinks that "birth and virtue are one and the same" - where does that idea come from? And where does that idea go in Evelina? What do you think about the representation of some aristocrats, like Lord Merton (see his behavior throughout; the "old lady race" is one of the wilder moments), in contrast with others, like Lord Orville? As you finish the novel, track developments between Evelina and Lord Orville alongside changes in her name and class status. What happens at the end, and what does that reveal about the novel's vision of questions of virtue (to use McKeon's term)? What about questions of truth?

Following on the letter from Lord Orville, Sir Clement gives Evelina a paper with a poem about her on it (page 369-371); why does she want to refuse it? What is the poem about? And what are its effects? In the beginning of the novel, we saw that Evelina thinks she would be alike unknown in the most retired or the most visible part of a theater; has this changed? And how?

Like *Robinson Crusoe*, this novel offers us a comic but strange near-final scene - the monkey and Mr. Lovel - to pair with the ending of the main narrative. The interpretation of the monkey scene is really an open question - can we develop an account of it together? Why is it there? What does it mean?

On Monday will also look briefly at some real eighteenth-century letters written by the writer and composer Ignatious Sancho to get a different perspective on the late eighteenth century from the one *Evelina* offers us and a stronger sense of eighteenth century London's diversity - Sancho was one of ~20,000 Black people living in London at the time.

3. For Text Exercise #4, all you must do is read + for Text Exercise #4: Tim Lee and Sean Trott, Large language models, explained with a minimum of math and jargon and write a single paragraph in your Text Exercise doc responding to it by asking a question about LLMs and Chat-GPT you still have after reading, noting something you don't fully understand, or sharing a thought prompted by the reading.

Optional but recommended: also read [Stephen Wolfram, What is CHATGPT Doing...and Why Does It Work.

If you still want more reading suggestions on this topic, let me know!

4. Wednesday we continue *Evelina*.

5. Friday we will finish *Evelina* and talk about Habermas's account of the creation of the public and private spheres, and see his new (to us) account of the novel in the formation and organization of modern subjectivity: “Subjectivity, as the innermost core of the private, was always already oriented to an audience"(49).

6. Brag: my co-authored book won another award this week: https://www.isu.edu/news/2023-fall/isu-announces-winner-of-2023-teaching-literature-book-award.html One of the reasons Swarthmore is unusual is that your professors by and large have the support they need to be serious about their research AND their teaching!

Until Monday,
RSB
